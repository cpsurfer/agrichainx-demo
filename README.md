# 🌿 AgriChainX Cloud: AI + Blockchain Food Traceability Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AgriChainX Cloud** is a revolutionary software-only platform that combines **Artificial Intelligence** and **Blockchain Technology** to create a transparent, tamper-proof food authenticity and traceability system. Our solution addresses the critical problem of food adulteration and fake product claims by establishing a digital chain of trust from farm to consumer.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **Food adulteration is rampant** - consumers have no reliable way to verify product purity
- **Existing certification systems** are paper-based, corruptible, and not digitally verifiable  
- **Supply chain opacity** makes it impossible to track food origins and handling
- **Consumer trust deficit** in food brands and producers

## 💡 Solution

A cloud-based food authenticity network that connects farmers, labs, distributors, and consumers through verifiable digital records, powered by:

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Computer vision and data analysis for food purity verification
- **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable records on Polygon/Ethereum testnet
- **QR Code System**: Consumer-friendly product verification
- **Trust Score Algorithm**: Reputation-based producer ranking system
